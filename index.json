This was something that I always wanted to try out/do since I recognized that being a parent and consultant travelling a lot was not aligning with my vision of the kind of dad I would like to be. I\u0026rsquo;ve talked to friends who embraced that idea (moving out of a big city, back to a smaller place where they\u0026rsquo;ve grown up, enjoying old friendships and different sense of community), read books (\u0026ldquo;Remote / Office not required\u0026rdquo;) and followed companies (e.g. GitLab) that went really big on remote before the whole pandemic made it a norm (for a \u0026ldquo;short\u0026rdquo; time). I also liked the idea that I didn\u0026rsquo;t restrict myself only to working for companies that are present where I live.\nAnd so, I started working for a Berlin-based company, where the majority of the folks were still living around Berlin. You could say this was remote-light, as I could also jump into a train and be in the office 2hrs later if we decided that we needed to meet in the office this week, plus we were all in the same timezone and we still relied a lot on synchronous communication. Maybe because of that, the company didn\u0026rsquo;t have very mature remote policies around how often should we meet in person etc. I enjoyed this first experience a lot, but at the same time, I started to realize how draining it was to spend so much time in calls and how different it was to build up relationships with people, especially when being in a managerial position. Around that time, I coined my rule to \u0026lsquo;whenever I can, meet people in person - especially if I have not created a working relationship with them yet\u0026rsquo; as I discovered that this helped a lot to establish rapport and understanding for one another / definitely sped this up in comparison to a pure remote setup.\nDuring that time, I worked from my home - I had a dedicated office, invested in my remote presence (wired connection, mic, camera and all those shenanigans), so that I could offer the best potential remote experience on the other side (when it comes to audio/video quality). I liked this setup, the ability to pick up my daughter from school, go for a run during the lunch break - the overall flexibility that remote work offered. At the same time, I discovered that I struggled with the transition between work and home as it was so quick: stand up, open the door, go to the living room, play with the kids. My brain was still busy with what had happened, what I needed to do, whom to write to, what would happen the next day. I tried to change my routine, but with at least 8 hours of work + family duties, it was hard to squeeze in better transition time.\nUnrelated to those experiences, I started working for another company. And discovered a more mature remote setup: a clear we meet every 3 months in our HQ (Munich) rhythm, a focus on remote-first culture, people based all across Europe and a budget for co-working. As other people I worked with were also based in Hamburg, we started to co-work from time to time and I discovered how good this felt - getting out of my home, being surrounded by other people. Seeing my team(s) every 3 months allowed me to plan specific initiatives for those co-located weeks that boosted our productivity and team connection. Yet, working from home started to feel more and more draining especially whenever work got more intense.\nThen my kids decided that it was time to push for each of them having their own room. That meant that I needed to figure out a different setup for my office: either move it to another room or rent something out. Given the experience so far, having a corner in my bedroom where my work life gravitates towards was really not an option I wanted to pursue, so instead, I swallowed the additional cost and rented myself a desk/space in a small shared office. I discovered how rusty my social skills had become (especially around people who I don\u0026rsquo;t really work with) but how good it felt to be around people in an office. The walk to and from the office did wonders to my ability to better separate work and the rest of my life. I really don\u0026rsquo;t know why I waited with that for so long.\nSo my conclusion (for future self): the clearer the separation between work and home, the better for me and having people around, makes me happier. All of that is definitely worth the additional cost of the office.\n","permalink":"https://lukasz.dev/blog/on-remote-work-and-office/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve been working fully remotely since 2021.

Some more stuff Office setup As a 100% remote-working person, I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to curate my home-office setup and while I was doing so, I\u0026rsquo;ve stumbled upon some people describing their choices and this helped me a lot. Thus I felt a bit inspired to do the same.\nDisplay I\u0026rsquo;m a one display kind of a person. I find this setup most ergonomic for me and the work that I\u0026rsquo;m currently doing. I\u0026rsquo;ve settled on a 27\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo; 4K monitor from Dell (U2720Q) that is also able to charge my notebook (this is a key characteristic as I try to have as little cables as possible). Using a 4K non ultra wide monitor makes sharing whole screen a bit easier for others as the scaling works out of the box on the receiving end. I\u0026rsquo;m using this monitor since 2020 and cannot really find a reason why I should change that.\nMicrophone I value audio quality and go an extra mile to provide very good level of it on the receiving end. For that reason, I\u0026rsquo;ve got the podmic from Rode. Apart from being really good at capturing me talking, it\u0026rsquo;s definitely a conversation starter with people that haven\u0026rsquo;t yet seen me in any calls (Do you do any podcasting? - No, I don\u0026rsquo;t / I just try to make my remote presence as good as possible).\nAudio Interface The mic I\u0026rsquo;ve listed above uses an XLR connection, so I needed also an audio interface to run it with my notebook. I went with Focusrite Scarlet Solo. (Talking about going down the rabbit hole\u0026hellip;)\nWebcam For a while I was using the Logitech Stream Cam but as I also enjoy making photos, I had Fujifilm X-T2 on my shelf. I once found out that Fuji offers an official software to operate the camera as an webcam. I liked this a lot and this became my standard setup. Sadly some mac update killed this and I needed to switch to a capture card (elgato camlink).\nSpeakers As I prefer to not wear headphones when not necessary and at home I don\u0026rsquo;t have any co-workers to worry about, I use Yamaha HS5 monitors for calls and enjoying music while coding alone.\nLight Sometimes I need additional lighting while recording or in a call, for that I\u0026rsquo;ve got this Logitech Litra Glow light. It\u0026rsquo;s very straight forward in its use and what I like the most, is the ability to dial down how intense it is.\nKeyboard(s) (Daily) UHK 60 v1 \u0026hellip;with Cherry MX brown switches and custom key caps by yuzu. I remember when I\u0026rsquo;ve learned about this keyboard/project while listening to the changelog podcast in 2015 and decided to join the crowd funding campaign. Few years later it finally arrived and I\u0026rsquo;ve really fell in love with it. Main reason to go with UHK was \u0026lsquo;staying on the home row\u0026rsquo; \u0026amp; the split design to prevent RSI from happening.\n(Occasional) Keychron K6 \u0026hellip;with Glorious Panda Pre-Lubed switches and key caps from Tai-Hao. After some time, I thought that I would be really nice to have a wireless keyboard with hot-swappable switches so that I could have one cable less to connect and also the ability to experiment a bit with different kind of switches. I really like Keychron keyboards as they have really good value-for-money ratio. The only problem: as this is not a split keyboard, whenever I use it for longer period of time my wrist/arm will start to complain.\nStanding desk A little Ikea hack combining a small bamboo top (I have a rather limited space. Thus, I went with a desk that has a small footprint) with height adjustable frame/legs. Officially those 2 do not fit, but one can easily drill additional holes in the bamboo top so that it can be mounted on the frame. If you ask yourself: Why should you even bother, to deal with a standing desk? Short answer: prolonged sitting kills.\nChair Having a proper office chair with good back support is a really important bit of the setup. For a while I was working using a simple Ikea chair and I\u0026rsquo;ve quickly developed pain in my lower back. Instead of spending a small fortune on a herman miller chair, a friend of mine recommended to look into steelcase office chairs. I\u0026rsquo;ve ended up with a white version of Series 1 as it feels less corporate.\nRug Don\u0026rsquo;t ask me why, but I wanted to have a rug under my desk (although I\u0026rsquo;m not a drummer / I feel a bit like a one). A friend of mine, discovered that her grandpa, who sailed on a commercial vessel in the past, left her a lot of rugs as he often brought some while traveling back from another part of the world.

It comes with a palette of production-ready choices for libraries solving problems that we face developing all kinds of services: be it from logging/metrics to async messaging or access to all the major sql and nosql data stores. Add the big talent pool (Java is very often used as the programming language used during CS-courses)[1] and it\u0026rsquo;s no wonder that this particular language and ecosystem is on the top or among the top 5 in the programming language statistics [2][3].\nHaving said that, I often feel that there is a certain fatigue when it comes to choice of the application framework. For me it seems that a lot of teams or even companies land on Spring without questioning if it\u0026rsquo;s actually the right tool for the particular task and what would be the alternatives. This is even more puzzling as microservices become a more and more popular architectural style and that IMHO changes a lot of the requirements one has for the app framework as e.g. memory footprint and startup time become way more relevant.\nThis post is by no means intended to say Spring is a wrong choice or something along those lines. It\u0026rsquo;s more a call-out to look at other alternatives in that space that may be just smaller, simpler and offer a more light-weight approach. And there is something to be told about the more light-weight approach too: It\u0026rsquo;s been a while that I\u0026rsquo;ve seen a team that truly understood all the batteries that are included in Spring and did not struggle from time to time with some of the concepts that are in play. Hence, I wanted to take a closer look at some of the other options that are around the block by implementing a small service, that is not so far off a real scenario: consume messages from a queue, aggregate certain information exposing it via an REST endpoint and implement it using spring and others. All code and exact numbers can be found in this repo. This post will be growing as I will be adding the result of my little experiment one by one over time. In the end it will be a summary of what I\u0026rsquo;ve discovered along the way and what you may also find interesting.\nSo let\u0026rsquo;s look at the options? All the options that I ended up taking into consideration address the changed nature of the systems that we write by switching from reflection-based approach to a compile-time based approach. They also support creation of native images thanks to GraalVM which makes the result both impressively fast to start and also very small. The tradeoff here is the duration of the compilation time. I will be looking at:\nMicronaut Quarkus Helidion If I managed to at least catch your interest, then watch the repo and this space for updates.\n","permalink":"https://lukasz.dev/blog/java-frameworks/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eJava/JVM ecosystem is extremely mature and vast.

Yes, pyramid:\nAt the base of the test automation pyramid is unit testing. Unit testing should be the foundation of a solid test automation strategy and as such represents the largest part of the pyramid. (\u0026hellip;) Automated user interface testing is placed at the top of the test automation pyramid because we want to do as little of it as possible. (\u0026hellip;) Testing through the user interface like this is expensive and should be minimized. Although there are many test cases that need to be invoked, not all need to be run through the user interface. And this is where the service layer of the test automation pyramid comes in. - Mike Cohn https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/the-forgotten-layer-of-the-test-automation-pyramid\nDepending on your personal style (look at this post by Martin Fowler for more details around different flavours of unit testing) and probably also the task at hand, you will either be starting with a unit test or acceptance/functional test. The rest of this post will show you how to set up each kind of test and give you a brief description of what we mean by saying unit, integration and functional test. I will also describe our gulp setup.\nUnit test In JavaScript and node.js world you are spoiled for choices in regards to your unit tests libraries and runners: Jasmine, Mocha and friends, just pick one. We decided to go with Jasmine, in which a test looks like this:\n/* jshint node: true */ /* global describe, beforeEach, afterEach, it, jasmine, expect */ \u0026#39;use strict\u0026#39;; describe(\u0026#39;exractParticipant\u0026#39;, function () { var extractParticipant; var validRequestData = { body: { firstname: \u0026#39;Mark\u0026#39;, lastname: \u0026#39;Mueller\u0026#39;, email: \u0026#39;m.mueller@example.com\u0026#39; } }; beforeEach(function () { extractParticipant= require(\u0026#39;../routes/registration.js\u0026#39;).extractParticipant }); it(\u0026#39;should read firstname from the request body\u0026#39;, function() { expect(extractParticipant(validRequestData).firstname).toBe(\u0026#39;Mark\u0026#39;); }); it(\u0026#39;should throw an error if no firstname can be found\u0026#39;, function () { function callWithNoFirstname() { extractParticipant({body: {}}); } expect(callWithNoFirstname).toThrow(); }); } Here we are verifying the behavior of the extractParticipant() function which given a request body returns a specific JS object. We can use multiple describe calls, or even nested describe calls to cluster the tested functionality. Each it call corresponds with a specific behaviour we want to verify. Jasmine provides matchers and spies to simplify our testing: Just look at the reference to see what\u0026rsquo;s possible. Generally it\u0026rsquo;s a good practice to verify one specific aspect per test. Any other recommendations, you ask {%gemoji sunglasses%} A good unit test is:\nfast: All the unit tests will be executed very often, therefore it\u0026rsquo;s necessary that their execution happens in ms atomic: The unit tests should be independent from one-another, so that you can run them parallel. This means that they should not rely on any side effects (data modifications done by other tests etc.). It\u0026rsquo;s also way easier to reason why a certain test is red, if all you need to care about is only the scope of that particular test. As usual Martin Fowler wrote a nice bliki about unit tests.\nIntegration test As the name already states, an integration test verifies the behaviour of a group of components of our software acting together. Look at the following test, which checks the integration between a service and the database:\n\u0026#39;use strict\u0026#39;; /* jshint node: true */ /* jshint esnext: true */ /* global describe, beforeEach, afterAll, it, jasmine, expect */ describe(\u0026#39;participants service\u0026#39;, function () { const participants = require(\u0026#39;../../service/participants\u0026#39;); var pg = require(\u0026#39;pg\u0026#39;); beforeEach(function (done) { var connectionString = process.env.SNAP_DB_PG_URL || \u0026#34;tcp://vagrant@localhost/pace\u0026#34;; var jasmineDone = done; pg.connect(connectionString, function (err, client, done) { client.query(\u0026#39;delete from participants\u0026#39;, function () { done(); jasmineDone(); }); } ); }); afterAll(function(done) { pg.end(); done(); }); it(\u0026#39;should store and read participants\u0026#39;, function (done) { var aParticipant = { firstname: \u0026#39;Hertha\u0026#39;, lastname: \u0026#39;Mustermann\u0026#39;, email: \u0026#39;h.mustermann@example.com\u0026#39; }; participants.save(aParticipant) .then(participants.getAll) .then(function (data) { expect(data.length).toBe(1); expect(data[0].firstname).toBe(aParticipant.firstname); expect(data[0].lastname).toBe(aParticipant.lastname); expect(data[0].email).toBe(aParticipant.email); done(); }); }); }); The integration test is similar to the unit one (it\u0026rsquo;s also based on jasmine), but instead of mocking our dependencies we use the real implementation (here the pg PostgreSQL client) and verify the integration of both components. In this particular example, we store a participant and expect that if we call the getAll function, it will be returned in the correct form. As the test will actually store objects in the dabase, we need to assure that before we execute the test, the database is cleared. This is done in the beforeEach method. You may ask \u0026lsquo;why before the test and not afterwards\u0026rsquo;: In case of an error, we will still have the possibility to check the state of the database.\nAs we need to connect to the database and assure a particular state before each test run, those tests will always be slower than the unit ones. Therefore we should try to test only the integrational aspects in them and everything else on the unit level. In the end we are not interested in a test suite for a 3rd party component, but only a verification of the fact that our usage of it is correct.\nFunctional test Whenever we test the system as a whole, we talk about functional tests. Typically those tests go against an outer-most interface of our app, often the UI. In our case we will interact with pace via its web page. To do that, we use WebDriverIO on top of selenium and a headless browser called phantomjs. This combination offers an easy to use API for browser-interaction.\n/* jshint node: true */ /* global describe, beforeEach, afterEach, it, jasmine, expect */ \u0026#39;use strict\u0026#39;; describe(\u0026#39;regisitration journey\u0026#39;, function () { var client; var paceUrl = process.env.PACE_URL || \u0026#39;http://localhost:3000/\u0026#39;; var originalTimeout; beforeEach(function () { var webdriverio = require(\u0026#39;webdriverio\u0026#39;); var options = { desiredCapabilities: { browserName: \u0026#39;phantomjs\u0026#39; } }; client = webdriverio.remote(options); originalTimeout = jasmine.DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_INTERVAL; jasmine.DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_INTERVAL = 10000; }); afterEach(function () { jasmine.DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_INTERVAL = originalTimeout; }); it(\u0026#39;allows to register via the registration page\u0026#39;, function (done) { client.init() .url(paceUrl) .click(\u0026#39;a#registration\u0026#39;) .setValue(\u0026#39;input#firstname\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Max\u0026#39;) .setValue(\u0026#39;input#lastname\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Mustermann\u0026#39;) .setValue(\u0026#39;input#email\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;max@example.com\u0026#39;) .setValue(\u0026#39;input#gender\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Unicorn\u0026#39;) .click(\u0026#39;button#submit\u0026#39;) .isVisible(\u0026#39;div.thanks\u0026#39;) .then(function (isVisible) { expect(isVisible).toBe(true); done(); }) .end(); }); }); First we need to setup the webdriver client to use the proper pace base url and browser. We also change the default jasmine timeout for async tests, as in general the browser based interactions tend to take more time. After that it is pretty straightforward: We click on a link, type into input fields, submit the form and verify that we land on the success page (look at webdriverio API for all the different interactions one can trigger). This is the happy path of our registration journey and as the functional test are the most expensive ones (in regards to the execution time), we will try to stick only to happy-path testing on this level.\nTest execution Ok, so how can you run all the tests in a convenient way? Pace uses gulp to build and automate a lot of stuff. Here are the important commands and convention:\nAll tests (specs) should be places in the /spec directory All integration tests must have \u0026lsquo;IT\u0026rsquo; in their filename All functional tests must have \u0026lsquo;Journey\u0026rsquo; in their filename gulp test - runs all the unit tests gulp test-integration - runs all the integration tests, depends on existing database gulp test-functional - runs all functional tests, depends on installed selenium-server and drivers To simplify the setup of a dev box, pace offers one simple command:\ngulp dev-setup - prepares the vagrant box with the databse, installs all dependencies for selenium and executes the database migrations ","permalink":"https://lukasz.dev/blog/2015/10/10/express-testing/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\n    \u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/media/test_pyramid.jpg\"/\u003e \n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\nAfter we managed to set up our basic \u003ca href=\"/blog/2015/08/04/bootstraping-a-node-dot-js-webapp/\"\u003eweb application\u003c/a\u003e,\nlet\u0026rsquo;s get our\nhands dirty writing some code.

We are a colorful bunch of people with different backgrounds, therefore we wanted to choose an approachable tech stack, as some of us wants also to learn one or two things about JavaScript, web applications or programming in general.\nAnd then, somebody suggested to write one thing or two, about our technology decisions and accompany it with some HowTo information. So here we are.\nThis is the first post out of the pace series. We will take a look at how to quickly bootstrap a new express.js application and what is actually happening during that process.\nFirst things first: node.js \u0026amp; express.js Node.js® is a platform built on Chrome\u0026rsquo;s JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices. - Nodejs.org https://nodejs.org\nProbably also due to the popularity of JavaScript node quickly spread all around the web and is nowadays widely used and has an impressive ecosystem of additional libraries/modules (just take a look at npm package manager).\nexpress.js is one of many web frameworks based on node, but seems also to be one of the most popular ones. What is a web framework you ask:\nA web application framework is a software framework that is designed to support the development of dynamic websites, web applications, web services and web resources. The framework aims to alleviate the overhead associated with common activities performed in web development. For example, many frameworks provide libraries for database access, templating frameworks and session management, and they often promote code reuse - http://localhost:1313/post/2016/02/22/bff/\nHow to bootstrap a web app \u0026amp; what happens Assuming you have node already installed on your machine (if not look at here)\nnpm install express-generator -g express myWebApp cd myWebApp npm install npm start What happened you ask? So first we globally installed express-generator (it will be now available to you via express cmd). Then we made it bootstrap for us an app called myWebApp. This resulted in the following:\n/tmp|⇒ express myWebApp create : myWebApp create : myWebApp/package.json create : myWebApp/app.js create : myWebApp/public create : myWebApp/public/javascripts create : myWebApp/public/images create : myWebApp/routes create : myWebApp/routes/index.js create : myWebApp/routes/users.js create : myWebApp/public/stylesheets create : myWebApp/public/stylesheets/style.css create : myWebApp/views create : myWebApp/views/index.jade create : myWebApp/views/layout.jade create : myWebApp/views/error.jade create : myWebApp/bin create : myWebApp/bin/www install dependencies: $ cd myWebApp \u0026amp;\u0026amp; npm install run the app: $ DEBUG=myWebApp ./bin/www The generator created for us a new directory which contains all the needed files the web application consists of:\npackage.json -\u0026gt; definition of our node dependencies and some node configuration app.js -\u0026gt; the main entry point into the application public -\u0026gt; contains all public assets which will be exposed to the public routes -\u0026gt; contains the definitions of our routes (as ourDomain/index or ourDomain/somethingDifferent) views -\u0026gt; contains our templates (more about this in future posts) bin/www -\u0026gt; executable application (if you run npm start this will be started) The execution of npm install in app\u0026rsquo;s directory, installs all the dependencies defined in the package.json file. Those dependencies will be installed only locally in the node_modules directory. After this step we are ready to go and able to run npm start which should result in this:\nmyWebApp|⇒ npm start \u0026gt; myWebApp@0.0.1 start /private/tmp/myWebApp \u0026gt; node ./bin/www GET / 200 305ms - 170b GET / 200 34ms - 170b GET /stylesheets/style.css 200 4ms - 110b GET / 304 25ms GET /stylesheets/style.css 304 1ms You can see, that I opened http://localhost:3000 in the browser and express served me the index page with the 200 code (you can also see that I refreshed the page and got 304 NOT MODIFIED). Everything works also as expected {%gemoji +1%}\nWhy? How? Let\u0026rsquo;s take a quick look at the following:\napp.js\nvar routes = require(\u0026#39;./routes/index\u0026#39;); app.use(\u0026#39;/\u0026#39;, routes) This is only a part of the app.js file but shows the wiring of our default root to the index.js file shown below. BTW: you can also see how to load dependencies/modules for our code via the require function (if you want to read more about that, here is a nice write-up)\nroutes/index.js:\nvar express = require(\u0026#39;express\u0026#39;); var router = express.Router(); /* GET home page. */ router.get(\u0026#39;/\u0026#39;, function(req, res) { title = \u0026#34;bootstraping a node dot js webapp\u0026#34; }); module.exports = router; The index.js uses express\u0026rsquo; router and wires request for / to the function responding with a rendered index.jade template, to which it passes a variable called title. If you never used jade, don\u0026rsquo;t worry, is a pretty simple HTML template engine. Look at the following: index.jade:\nextends layout block content h1= title p Welcome to #{title} Jade enables template composition. In here we extend layout.jade which defines the general page structure.

But that was actually no problem at all, as I paired with another guy who had some rails experience. Although I heard it often, I was still amazed how quickly one can set up a CRUD application with it. There is of course a lot of magic happening in the background and when you have some more complicated use cases, you really need to look deeper into the rails guide or other documentation. My pair and myself had some issues trying to integrate a WYSIWYG editor which was working in the development mode but not in the production mode due to some assets processing problems. This was the only problem we could not solve quickly. For templates we used slim which is definitely nice, but takes some time getting used to. Otherwise Rails provides as I already expected a very nice developer experience. As I am taking a deeper look into Play2.0 now, I can try to write the same application to be able to compare the development speed and experience of both frameworks. A blog post will follow.

I took some time, sat down and thought about the technology stack, I would like to use to build it. As we wanted to have an RIA and I already had some experience with GWT, we quickly decided to use it. Since then four years have passed and we are about to release the 2.0 version of our system. During this time, the whole team learned a lot about GWT, its advantages and also some disadvantages, and I thought it would be useful to write some of them up. This part is about the status quo, in the second part I will try to write about a GWT setup I would go for, when starting the project today - so if you have any hints in this regard, please feel free to leave a comment, I would definitely appreciate it!\n1. Client setup Around the same time, as I started to draw the first diagrams of the inner life of our web app, Ray Ryan gave a talk at the IO conference about the best practices for GWT app architecture, mentioning the model view presenter, the usage of an event bus for components communication and the command pattern for dispatching the GWT-RPC calls to the server. Shortly after I discovered the gwt-presenter and the gwt-dispatch libraries, offering an easy way to build an GWT app based on the principles from Ray\u0026rsquo;s talk. I also found a very detailed blog post explaining how everything works together.\nMVP with EventBus and Dispatcher At this point we defined one Presenter for all the entities, we wanted to made accessible on the client, and each presenter defined his own Display interface which then was implemented by the View class. The instantiation of all presenters and views has been managed by gin - a dependency injection framework for the client side. The code looked more or less like this:\nPresenter \u0026amp; Display:\npublic class HistoryPresenter extends WidgetPresenter\u0026lt;HistoryPresenter.Display\u0026gt; implements PresentsDTO\u0026lt;HistoryDTO\u0026gt; { public interface Display extends WidgetDisplay, Resettable, Editable { HasText getPrimaryDisease(); HasText getPrimaryDiagnosis(); HasValue\u0026lt;Date\u0026gt; getPrimaryDiseaseStart(); HasValue\u0026lt;String\u0026gt; getHypertension(); // (...) and some more stuff here } private HistoryDTO currentDTO; private final DispatchAsync dispatcher; @Inject public HistoryPresenter(final Display display, final EventBus eventBus, final DispatchAsync dispatcher) { super(display, eventBus); bind(); } @Override protected void onBind() { // Add handlers to the event bus if needed } @Override public void resetUI() { currentDTO = null; display.resetUI(); } @Override public HistoryDTO getDTO() { syncDTO(); return currentDTO; } @Override public void syncDTO() { // create new DTO object with the content from the display } @Override public void showDTO(HistoryDTO dto) { // refresh the display with the data from the DTO } @Override public void setEditable(boolean value) { display.setEditable(value); } @Override protected void onRevealDisplay() { // React on place request e.g use the dispatcher to load the data from the server } } In the gwt-presenter class hierarchy there was no possibility to define the model class the presenter will be responsible for. For that reason we introduced a PresentDTO\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; and PresentDTOs\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; interfaces to ensure the existence of T getDTO() etc. methods. The view classes are quite straightforward, the only difference is that back in 2009 ui:binder was not really there, therefore the gwt-presenter had no direct support for it. But switching to the declarative layout definition was indeed very easy - each view defines its own *.ui.xml file and the asWidget() method just returns the result of the uiBinder.createAndBindUi() call. As you can see in the code below we introduced also a WidgetsManager class which is a convinient way to managed all the widgets the view is defining (offering a general setEditable() method and taking care of the validation visualization).\nView:\npublic class HistoryView implements Display { interface HistoryViewUiBinder extends UiBinder\u0026lt;LayoutPanel, HistoryView\u0026gt; {} private static HistoryViewUiBinder uiBinder = GWT.create(HistoryViewUiBinder.class); @UiField LabeledSuggestBox renalDisease; @UiField DateBox renalDiseaseStart; @UiField TextArea renalDiseaseText; @UiField ValueListBox hypertension; private final WidgetsManager widgetsManager; private final LayoutPanel content; @Inject public HistoryView(WidgetsManager widgetsManager, final RegisterConstants c) { this.widgetsManager = widgetsManager; content = uiBinder.createAndBindUi(this); content.setTitle(c.historyTab()); //Registering the widgets within the widget mgr. widgetsManager.registerWidgets( new String[] {\u0026#34;primaryDiseaseGroup\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;primaryDiseaseDiagnosis\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;primaryDiseaseStart\u0026#34;}, new Widget[] { renalDisease, renalDiseaseText, renalDiseaseStart}); widgetsManager.configureValidation(HistoryDTO.class); } @Override public Widget asWidget() { return content; } @Override public HasText getPrimaryDiagnosis() { return renalDiseaseText; } @Override public HasText getPrimaryDisease() { return renalDisease; } @Override public HasValue\u0026lt;Date\u0026gt; getPrimaryDiseaseStart() { return renalDiseaseStart; } } To ensure a loosely coupled client we try to communicate between the presenters only via the EventBus or PlaceRequests, so if a new part of the UI should be rendered, a new place event needs to be fired.\n2. Client - server communication The client - server communication is based fully on the GWT-RPC mechanism. As mentioned above we are using the gwt-dispatch library meaning that for every request, we have a command object, result object and a server side handler. It is a bit verbose, but in the end it is also a very simple pattern and every new dev introduced to our team grasps it very quickly. The implementation of the client-side caching is easily done, as you just need to compare the command object which should be executed and if one of them has been already seen, then you can serve the already received result saving you one round-trip.\nTo execute a command a corresponding object just needs to be passed to the dispatcher which is a singleton on the client and gets injected to every presenter that should be able to trigger the communication. In most of the cases the result of a command (or to use gwt-dispatch terminology: an action) contains a DTO object which is then shown by the presenter. On the server side we are using JPA \u0026amp; Hibernate so obviously we need to take care of the server entity to DTO conversion. Although some libraries exists for this purpose (e.g gilead), in our specific setting we decided to implement it ourself which was actually a straightforward task when using the reflection API and sticking to a well defined class hierarchy of our own. DTO We also use the JSR303 annotations for validation of the entities and are able to push the constraint violations back to the client where they will be assigned to the specific widgets by our WidgetsManager - here we are just using a simple convention of associating the input widgets with same names as the property paths in the entities.\n3. Testing the client One of the main advantages of doing MVP is the separation of the business logic (sitting in the presenter) from the actual UI components (being a part of the view) resulting in the ability of writing normal, fast unit test (normal, meaning not using the GWTTestCase) and mocking the views. Nevertheless in our project we use selenium as the main way to assure the correct functionality of our client. As using the normal selenium recorder is not an option with GWT due to the element ids changing during each compile process, we tried to get our selenium tests (written in java as normal unit tests) as independent as it only can be from the layout definition itself (trying not to use exact XPath etc.). Our client is very data input heavy, so we have a lot of input components to test. When we test if the entities get created in a correct way, we just access all visible input components of a certain type, populate them with a random content (which we then store for later comparison), trigger the save action and reload the UI to verify if the same components holds still the same data. Thus, we don\u0026rsquo;t have to update the tests if our data definition changes and we have introduced some new input components. The test will also work if the layout of the UI changes either on purpose, because we rearranged it, or when a new GWT version switch to a different HTML representation for some standard widgets.\nGetting certain elements from selenium driver:\nprotected static ArrayList\u0026lt;WebElement\u0026gt; getVisibleElements(String tagName, final String classString) { List\u0026lt;WebElement\u0026gt; elements = driver.findElements(By.tagName(tagName)); return Lists.newArrayList(Collections2.filter(elements, new Predicate\u0026lt;WebElement\u0026gt;() { @Override public boolean apply(@Nullable WebElement input) { boolean b = false; try { String classAttribute = input.getAttribute(\u0026#34;class\u0026#34;); b = input.isDisplayed() \u0026amp;\u0026amp; classAttribute != null \u0026amp;\u0026amp; classAttribute.contains(classString); } catch (StaleElementReferenceException e) { // Ignoring stale element } return b; } })); } 4. Issues We are quite happy how things are working now, but there is room for improvement:\nThe compile time during development: trying to change something in the client code in a iterative manner using the standard DevMode is very frustrating as it takes just too much time. SuperDevMode improved a lot our situation but we still have the problem of having the server and client side in one maven project - changing the server-side code means a mvn clean -DskipTests tomcat7:run-war and this means basically an \u0026ldquo;espresso\u0026rdquo; break. The size of the client: our *.cache.js file is currently 6.1MB (we use the gwtquery and gwt-chosen libs which are quite large) We will definitely try to introduce some code splitting in the future release, to load only as much as we need and not everything from the beginning. Execution time of the selenium tests: our current selenium suite takes a bit over 3 hours to run on our CI server. And although we could, we don\u0026rsquo;t have enough of the presenter unit tests to have a sufficient coverage letting us sleep well at night. Here probably a wrong choice have been made: concentrating to much on the selenium tests and trying to go for a very exhaustive test suite, instead of implementing a good amount of unit tests for the presenters and a simpler selenium suite for the main work flows in the application.

Therefore the access is fairly simple and I can use my blog to link to other stuff, I have on github or somewhere else like e.g. slides to my talks.
