    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right" src="/images/test_pyramid.jpg" width="400" height="300" title="Test pyramid" >
After we managed to set up our basic <a href="/blog/2015/08/04/bootstraping-a-node-dot-js-webapp/">web application</a>,
let&rsquo;s get our
hands dirty writing some code. And as we want to do it in a test-driven
manner (<a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDrivenDevelopment.html">TDD</a>), we need
a proper test setup. This piece is all about our initial test pyramid. Test,
what? Yes, pyramid:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>At the base of the test automation pyramid is unit testing. Unit testing should<br/>be the foundation of a solid test automation strategy and as such represents<br/>the largest part of the pyramid. (&hellip;) Automated user interface testing is<br/>placed at the top of the test automation pyramid because we want to do as<br/>little of it as possible. (&hellip;) Testing through the user interface like this is<br/>expensive and should be minimized. Although there are many test cases that need<br/>to be invoked, not all need to be run through the user interface. And this is<br/>where the service layer of the test automation pyramid comes in.</p><footer><strong>Mike Cohn <a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/the-forgotten-layer-of-the-test-automation-pyramid">https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/the-forgotten-layer-of-the-test-automation-pyramid</a></strong></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>Depending on your personal style (look at this
<a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestPyramid.html">post</a> by Martin Fowler for
more details around different <em>flavours</em> of unit testing) and probably also the
task at hand, you will either be starting with a unit test or
acceptance/functional test. The rest of this post will show you how to set up
each kind of test and give you a brief description of what we mean by saying
<strong>unit</strong>, <strong>integration</strong> and <strong>functional</strong> test. I will also describe our
<strong>gulp setup</strong>.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Unit test</h2>

<p>In JavaScript and node.js world your are spoiled for choices in regards to
your unit tests libraries and runners: Jasmine, Mocha and friends, just pick
one. We decided to go with
<a href="https://jasmine.github.io/2.3/introduction.html">Jasmine</a>, in which a test
looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">/* jshint node: true */
/* global describe, beforeEach, afterEach, it, jasmine, expect */
'use strict';
describe('exractParticipant', function () {
  var extractParticipant;
  var validRequestData = {
    body: {
      firstname: 'Mark',
      lastname: 'Mueller',
      email: 'm.mueller@example.com'
    }
  };

  beforeEach(function () {
    extractParticipant= require('../routes/registration.js').extractParticipant
  });

  it('should read firstname from the request body', function() {
    expect(extractParticipant(validRequestData).firstname).toBe('Mark');
  });

  it('should throw an error if no firstname can be found', function () {
    function callWithNoFirstname() {
      extractParticipant({body: {}});
    }

    expect(callWithNoFirstname).toThrow();
  });
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here we are verifying the behavior of the <code>extractParticipant()</code> function
which given a request body returns a specific JS object. We can use multiple
 <code>describe</code> calls, or even nested <code>describe</code> calls to cluster the
tested functionality. Each <code>it</code> call corresponds with a specific behaviour
we want to verify. <strong>Jasmine</strong> provides matchers and spies to simplify our
testing: Just look at the
<a href="https://jasmine.github.io/2.3/introduction.html">reference</a> to see what&rsquo;s
possible.  Generally it&rsquo;s a good practice to verify one specific aspect per
test. Any other recommendations, you ask <img alt="sunglasses" src="/images/emoji/unicode/1f60e.png" class="emoji" /> A good unit test
is:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>fast</strong>: All the unit tests will be executed very often, therefore it&rsquo;s
necessarry that their execution happens in ms</li>
<li><strong>atomic</strong>: The unit tests should be independant from one-another, so that you can
run them parallel. This means that they should not relay on any side
effects (data modifications done by other tests etc.). It&rsquo;s also way easier
to reason why a certain test is red, if all you need to care about is only
the scope of that particular test.</li>
</ul>


<p>As usual Martin Fowler wrote a nice <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/UnitTest.html">bliki about unit tests</a>.</p>

<h2>Integration test</h2>

<p>As the name already states, an integration test verifies the behaviour of
a group of components of our software acting together. Look at the following
test, which checks the intgeration between a service and the database:</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">'use strict';
/* jshint node: true */
/* jshint esnext: true */
/* global describe, beforeEach, afterAll, it, jasmine, expect */

describe('participants service', function () {

    const participants = require('../../service/participants');
    var pg = require('pg');

    beforeEach(function (done) {
        var connectionString = process.env.SNAP_DB_PG_URL || "tcp://vagrant@localhost/pace";
        var jasmineDone = done;

        pg.connect(connectionString, function (err, client, done) {
                client.query('delete from participants', function () {
                    done();
                    jasmineDone();
                });
            }
        );

    });

    afterAll(function(done) {
        pg.end();
        done();
    });


    it('should store and read participants', function (done) {
        var aParticipant = {
            firstname: 'Hertha',
            lastname: 'Mustermann',
            email: 'h.mustermann@example.com'
        };

        participants.save(aParticipant)
            .then(participants.getAll)
            .then(function (data) {
                expect(data.length).toBe(1);
                expect(data[0].firstname).toBe(aParticipant.firstname);
                expect(data[0].lastname).toBe(aParticipant.lastname);
                expect(data[0].email).toBe(aParticipant.email);
                done();
            });
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>The integration test is similiar to the unit one (it&rsquo;s also based on jasmine),
but instead of mocking our dependencies we use the real implementation (here
the <code>pg</code> PostgreSQL client) and verify the integration of both components.
In this particular example, we store a participant and expect that if we call
the <code>getAll</code> function, it will be returned in the correct form. As the
test will actually store objects in the dabase, we need to assure that before
we execute the test, the database is cleared. This is done in the
 <code>beforeEach</code> method. You may ask &lsquo;why before the test and not afterwards&rsquo;:
In case of an error, we will still have the possibility to check the state of
the database.</p>

<p>As we need to connect to the database and assure a particular state before
each test run, those tests will always be slower than the unit ones. Therefore
we should try to test only the integrational aspects in them and everything
else on the unit level. In the end we are not interested in a test suite for
a 3rd party component, but only a verification of the fact that our usage of
it is correct.</p>

<h2>Functional test</h2>

<p>Whenever we test the system as a whole, we talk about functional tests.
Typically those tests go against an outer-most interface of our app, often
the UI. In our case we will interact with pace via its web page.
To do that, we use <a href="http://webdriver.io/">WebDriverIO</a> on top of <a href="http://docs.seleniumhq.org/">selenium</a> and a headless browser called <a href="http://phantomjs.org/">phantomjs</a>. This combination offers an easy to use API for browser-interaction.</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">/* jshint node: true */
/* global describe, beforeEach, afterEach, it, jasmine, expect */
'use strict';
describe('regisitration journey', function () {
    var client;
    var paceUrl = process.env.PACE_URL || 'http://localhost:3000/';
    var originalTimeout;

    beforeEach(function () {
        var webdriverio = require('webdriverio');
        var options = {
            desiredCapabilities: {
                browserName: 'phantomjs'
            }
        };

        client = webdriverio.remote(options);
        originalTimeout = jasmine.DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_INTERVAL;
        jasmine.DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_INTERVAL = 10000;
    });

    afterEach(function () {
        jasmine.DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_INTERVAL = originalTimeout;
    });

    it('allows to register via the registration page', function (done) {

        client.init()
            .url(paceUrl)
            .click('a#registration')
            .setValue('input#firstname', 'Max')
            .setValue('input#lastname', 'Mustermann')
            .setValue('input#email', 'max@example.com')
            .setValue('input#gender', 'Unicorn')
            .click('button#submit')
            .isVisible('div.thanks')
            .then(function (isVisible) {
                expect(isVisible).toBe(true);
                done();
            })
            .end();
    });

});
</code></pre>

<p>First we need to setup the webdriver client to use the proper pace base url and
browser. We also change the default jasmine timeout for async tests, as in
general the browser based interactions tend to take more time. After that it is
pretty straightforward: We click on a link, type into input fields, submit
the form and verify that we land on the success page (look at
<a href="http://webdriver.io/api.html">webdriverio API</a> for all the different interactions
one can trigger). This is the happy path of our registration journey and as the
functional test are the most expensive ones (in regards to the execution time),
we will try to stick only to happy-path testing on this level.</p>

<h2>Test execution</h2>

<p>Ok, so how can you run all the tests in a convenient way? Pace uses <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">gulp</a> to build and automate a lot of stuff. Here are the important commands and convention:</p>

<ul>
<li>All tests (specs) should be places in the <strong>/spec</strong> directory</li>
<li>All integration tests must have &lsquo;<strong>IT</strong>&rsquo; in their filename</li>
<li>All functional tests must have &lsquo;<strong>Journey</strong>&rsquo; in their filename</li>
<li><code>gulp test</code> - runs all the unit tests</li>
<li><code>gulp test-integration</code> - runs all the integration tests, depends on
existing database</li>
<li><code>gulp test-functional</code> - runs all functional tests, depends on installed
selenium-server and drivers</li>
</ul>


<p>To simplify the setup of a dev box, pace offers one simple command:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>gulp dev-setup</code> - prepares the vagrant box with the databse, installs
all dependencies for selenium and executes the database migrations</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Together with few friends we started building <strong><a href="https://github.com/lplotni/pace">pace</a></strong> - a web application for
organizing and managing running events &amp; competitions. We are a colorful bunch of people with different backgrounds, therefore we wanted to choose an approachable tech stack, as some of us wants also to learn one or two things about <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>web applications</strong> or <strong>programming</strong> in general.</p>

<p>And then, somebody suggested to write one thing or two, about our technology
decisions and accompany it with some <em>HowTo</em> information. So here we are.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>This is the first post out of the <strong>pace</strong> series. We will take a look at how to quickly bootstrap a new express.js application and what is acctually happening during that process.</p>

<h2>First things first: node.js &amp; express.js</h2>

<p><blockquote><p>Node.js® is a platform  built on Chrome&rsquo;s JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.</p><footer><strong>Nodejs.org <a href="https://nodejs.org">https://nodejs.org</a></strong></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>Probably also due to the popularity of JavaScript <a href="https://nodejs.org/">node</a> quickly spread all around the web and is nowadays widely <a href="https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/projects,-applications,-and-companies-using-node">used</a> and has an impressive ecosystem of additional libraries/modules (just take a look at <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm package manager</a>).</p>

<p><a href="http://expressjs.com/">express.js</a> is one of many web frameworks based on node, but seems also to be one of the most popular ones. What is a web framework you ask:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>A web application framework is a software framework that is designed to support the development of dynamic websites, web applications, web services and web resources. The framework aims to alleviate the overhead associated with common activities performed in web development. For example, many frameworks provide libraries for database access, templating frameworks and session management, and they often promote code reuse</p><footer><strong>Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application_framework">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application_framework</a></strong></footer></blockquote></p>

<h3>How to bootstrap a web app &amp; what happens</h3>

<p>Assuming you have node already installed on your machine (if not look at <a href="https://nodejs.org/download/">here</a>)</p>

<pre><code class="bash">npm install express-generator -g
express myWebApp
cd myWebApp
npm install
npm start
</code></pre>

<p>What happened you ask? So first we globally installed <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-generator">express-generator</a> (it will be now available to you via <em>express</em> cmd). Then we made it bootstrap for us an app called <em>myWebApp</em>. This resulted in the following:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">/tmp|⇒ express myWebApp

   create : myWebApp
   create : myWebApp/package.json
   create : myWebApp/app.js
   create : myWebApp/public
   create : myWebApp/public/javascripts
   create : myWebApp/public/images
   create : myWebApp/routes
   create : myWebApp/routes/index.js
   create : myWebApp/routes/users.js
   create : myWebApp/public/stylesheets
   create : myWebApp/public/stylesheets/style.css
   create : myWebApp/views
   create : myWebApp/views/index.jade
   create : myWebApp/views/layout.jade
   create : myWebApp/views/error.jade
   create : myWebApp/bin
   create : myWebApp/bin/www

   install dependencies:
     $ cd myWebApp &amp;&amp; npm install

   run the app:
     $ DEBUG=myWebApp ./bin/www
</code></pre>

<p>The generator created for us a new directory which contains all the needed files the web application consists of:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>package.json</strong> -> definition of our node dependencies and some node configuration</li>
<li><strong>app.js</strong> -> the main entry point into the application</li>
<li><strong>public</strong> -> contains all public assets whic will be exposed to the public</li>
<li><strong>routes</strong> -> contains the definitions of our routes (as ourDomain/index or ourDomain/somethingDifferent)</li>
<li><strong>views</strong> -> contains our templates (more about this in future posts)</li>
<li><strong>bin/www</strong> -> executable application (if you run <code>npm start</code> this will be started)</li>
</ul>


<p>The execution of <code>npm install</code> in app&rsquo;s directory, installs all the dependencies defined in the <code>package.json</code> file. Those dependencies will be installed only locally in the <code>node_modules</code> directory. After this step we are ready to go and able to run <code>npm start</code> which should result in this:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">myWebApp|⇒ npm start

&gt; myWebApp@0.0.1 start /private/tmp/myWebApp
&gt; node ./bin/www

GET / 200 305ms - 170b
GET / 200 34ms - 170b
GET /stylesheets/style.css 200 4ms - 110b
GET / 304 25ms
GET /stylesheets/style.css 304 1ms
</code></pre>

<p>You can see, that I opened <a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a> in the browser and express served me the index page with the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html">200 code</a> (you can also see that I refreshed the page and got 304 NOT MODIFIED). Everything works also as expected <img alt="+1" src="/images/emoji/unicode/1f44d.png" class="emoji" /></p>

<p><strong>Why? How?</strong> Let&rsquo;s take a quick look at the following:</p>

<pre><code class="JavaScript app.js">var routes = require('./routes/index');

app.use('/', routes)
</code></pre>

<p>This is only a part of the <code>app.js</code> file but shows the wiring of our default root to the index.js file shown below. BTW: you can also see how to load dependencies/modules for our code via the <code>require</code> function (if you want to read more about that, <a href="http://openmymind.net/2012/2/3/Node-Require-and-Exports/">here is a nice write-up</a>)</p>

<pre><code class="JavaScript routes/index.js">var express = require('express');
var router = express.Router();

/* GET home page. */
router.get('/', function(req, res) {
  res.render('index', { title: 'Express' });
});

module.exports = router;
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>index.js</code> uses express' <code>router</code> and wires request for <strong>/</strong> to the function responding with a rendered <code>index.jade</code> template, to which it passes a variable called <code>title</code>. If you never used <a href="http://jade-lang.com/">jade</a>, don&rsquo;t worry, is a pretty simple HTML template engine. Look at the following:</p>

<pre><code class="jade index.jade">extends layout

block content
  h1= title
  p Welcome to #{title}
</code></pre>

<p>Jade enables template composition. In here we extend <code>layout.jade</code> which defines the general page structure. If other template defines a <strong>block</strong> called <code>content</code> it will be then injected at the corresponding place.</p>

<pre><code class="jade layout.jade">doctype html
html
  head
    title= title
    link(rel='stylesheet', href='http://lplotni.github.io/stylesheets/style.css')
  body
    block content
</code></pre>

<p>Jade is indentation aware, meaning that the above example results in the following:</p>

<pre><code class="HTML">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Express&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="http://lplotni.github.io/stylesheets/style.css"&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Express&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Welcome to Express&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now you have seen all the parts making the browser render the most basic page of all time <img alt="sunglasses" src="/images/emoji/unicode/1f60e.png" class="emoji" /></p>

<p>Next post out of the <strong>pace</strong> series, will actually explain how to start working on the functionality we need. Right now you can start to play around with the data which is passed by the <code>index.js</code> to the <code>index.jade</code> template and how the template uses it. Have fun!</p>

    <updated>2015-06-27T15:41:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://lplotni.github.io/blog/2015/06/27/build-monitors</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>During my last four projects or so, the teams I worked with were always using <a href="http://www.go.cd/">GO.CD</a> as the CD tool of their
choosing. Although the pipeline state visualisation GO.CD comes with is quite nice, it still doesn&rsquo;t cut it as a proper,
<em>obvious</em> build monitor enabling everybody in the team to quickly recognize what is the pipeline status.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/burstah_example.png" title="Burstah in action" ></p>

<p>Therefore first <a href="https://github.com/lplotni/cidar">cidar</a>, a simple sinatra based build monitor, has been born. I quickly discovered
that sinatra and especially the nokogiri dependency, doesn&rsquo;t make it easy to use e.g. a Raspberry Pi as the monitor hardware. So,
having the liberty, I decided to re-implement everything in JavaScript using node.js &amp; express. <a href="https://github.com/lplotni/burstah">Burstah</a>
, my second attempt at the ultimative build monitor, has been born  <img alt="bowtie" src="/images/emoji/bowtie.png" class="emoji" /></p>

<!--more-->


<p>All the necessary information how to use, install or contribute can be found in <strong>Burstah</strong>&rsquo;s readme.</p>

<p>Currently <strong>Burstah</strong> has following features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Polling for the cctray.xml to recognize the pipelines and their status</li>
<li>Grabbing the commit details directly out of the GO.CD and presenting them</li>
<li>Providing an animation when the build is running</li>
<li>Supporting emojis in the commit messages <img alt="thumbsup" src="/images/emoji/unicode/1f44d.png" class="emoji" /></li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Back in 2009 I became the job to design and start realizing a quite large web application for a health care research project. I took some time, sat down and thought about the technology stack, I would like to use to build it. As we wanted to have an RIA and I already had some experience with GWT, we quickly decided to use it. Since then four years have passed and we are about to release the 2.0 version of our system. During this time, the whole team learned a lot about GWT, its advantages and also some disadvantages, and I thought it would be useful to write some of them up. This part is about the <strong>status quo</strong>, in the second part I will try to write about a GWT setup I would go for, when starting the project today - so if you have any hints in this regard, please feel free to leave a comment, I would definitely appreciate it!</p>

<h2>1. Client setup</h2>

<p>Around the same time, as I started to draw the first diagrams of the inner life of our web app, Ray Ryan gave a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDuhR18-EdM">talk at the IO conference</a> about the best practices for GWT app architecture, mentioning the <a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/uiArchs.html">model view presenter</a>, the usage of an event bus for components communication and the command pattern for dispatching the GWT-RPC calls to the server. Shortly after I discovered the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gwt-presenter/">gwt-presenter</a> and the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gwt-dispatch/">gwt-dispatch</a> libraries, offering an easy way to build an GWT app based on the principles from  Ray&rsquo;s talk. I also found a very detailed <a href="http://blog.hivedevelopment.co.uk/2009/08/google-web-toolkit-gwt-mvp-example.html">blog post</a> explaining how everything works together.  <img src="/images/gwt_mvp.png" title="MVP with EventBus and Dispatcher" > At this point we defined one <strong>Presenter</strong> for all the entities, we wanted to made accessible on the client, and each presenter defined his own <strong>Display</strong> interface which then was implemented by the <strong>View</strong> class. The instantiation of all presenters and views has been managed by <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-gin/">gin</a> - a dependency injection framework for the client side. The code looked more or less like this:
<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Presenter &amp; Display</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

In the gwt-presenter class hierarchy there was no possibility to define the model class the presenter will be responsible for. For that reason we introduced a <code>PresentDTO\&lt;T></code> and <code>PresentDTOs\&lt;T></code> interfaces to ensure the existence of <code>T getDTO()</code> etc. methods. The view classes are quite straightforward, the only difference is that back in 2009 ui:binder was not really there, therefore the gwt-presenter had no direct support for it. But switching to the declarative layout definition was indeed very easy - each view defines its own *.ui.xml file and the <code>asWidget()</code> method just returns the result of the <code>uiBinder.createAndBindUi()</code> call. As you can see in the code below we introduced also a <code>WidgetsManager</code> class which is a convinient way to managed all the widgets the view is defining (offering a general <code>setEditable()</code> method and taking care of the validation visualization).</p>

<pre><code class="java View">public class HistoryView implements Display {
    interface HistoryViewUiBinder extends UiBinder&lt;LayoutPanel, HistoryView&gt; {}
    private static HistoryViewUiBinder uiBinder = GWT.create(HistoryViewUiBinder.class);

    @UiField
    LabeledSuggestBox renalDisease;
    @UiField
    DateBox renalDiseaseStart;
    @UiField
    TextArea renalDiseaseText;
    @UiField
    ValueListBox hypertension;

    private final WidgetsManager widgetsManager;
    private final LayoutPanel content;

    @Inject
    public HistoryView(WidgetsManager widgetsManager, final RegisterConstants c) {
        this.widgetsManager = widgetsManager;
        content = uiBinder.createAndBindUi(this);
        content.setTitle(c.historyTab());
        //Registering the widgets within the widget mgr.
        widgetsManager.registerWidgets(
                new String[] {"primaryDiseaseGroup",
                        "primaryDiseaseDiagnosis", "primaryDiseaseStart"},
                new Widget[] {
                        renalDisease,
                        renalDiseaseText,
                        renalDiseaseStart});
        widgetsManager.configureValidation(HistoryDTO.class);
    }

    @Override
    public Widget asWidget() {
        return content;
    }

    @Override
    public HasText getPrimaryDiagnosis() {
        return renalDiseaseText;
    }

    @Override
    public HasText getPrimaryDisease() {
        return renalDisease;
    }

    @Override
    public HasValue&lt;Date&gt; getPrimaryDiseaseStart() {
        return renalDiseaseStart;
    }

<p>To ensure a loosely coupled client we try to communicate between the presenters only via the EventBus or PlaceRequests, so if a new part of the UI should be rendered, a new place event needs to be fired.</p>

<h2>2. Client - server communication</h2>

<p>The client - server communication is based fully on the GWT-RPC mechanism. As mentioned above we are using the gwt-dispatch library meaning that for every request, we have a command object, result object and a server side handler. It is a bit verbose, but in the end it is also a very simple pattern and every new dev introduced to our team grasps it very quickly. The implementation of the client-side caching is easily done, as you just need to compare the command object which should be executed and if one of them has been already seen, then you can serve the already received result saving you one round-trip.</p>

<p>To execute a command a corresponding object just needs to be passed to the dispatcher which is a singleton on the client and gets injected to every presenter that should be able to trigger the communication. In most of the cases the result of a command (or to use gwt-dispatch terminology: an action) contains a DTO object which is then shown by the presenter. On the server side we are using JPA &amp; Hibernate so obviously we need to take care of the server entity to DTO conversion. Although some libraries exists for this purpose (e.g <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gilead/">gilead</a>), in our specific setting we decided to implement it ourself which was actually a straightforward task when using the reflection API and sticking to a well defined class hierarchy of our own. <img src="/images/dto.png" title="MVP with EventBus and Dispatcher" > We also use the JSR303 annotations for validation of the entities and are able to push the constraint violations back to the client where they will be assigned to the specific widgets by our <code>WidgetsManager</code> - here we are just using a simple convention of associating the input widgets with same names as the property paths in the entities.</p>

<h2>3. Testing the client</h2>

<p>One of the main advantages of doing MVP is the separation of the business logic (sitting in the presenter) from the actual UI components (being a part of the view) resulting in the ability of writing normal, fast unit test (normal, meaning not using the GWTTestCase) and mocking the views. Nevertheless in our project we use <a href="http://docs.seleniumhq.org/">selenium</a> as the main way to assure the correct functionality of our client. As using the normal selenium recorder is not an option with GWT due to the element ids changing during each compile process, we tried to get our selenium tests (written in java as normal unit tests) as independent as it only can be from the layout definition itself (trying not to use exact XPath etc.). Our client is very data input heavy, so we have a lot of input components to test. When we test if the entities get created in a correct way, we just access all visible input components of a certain type, populate them with a random content (which we then store for later comparison), trigger the save action and reload the UI to verify if the same components holds still the same data. Thus, we don&rsquo;t have to update the tests if our data definition changes and we have introduced some new input components. The test will also work if the layout of the UI changes either on purpose, because we rearranged it, or when a new GWT version switch to a different HTML representation for some standard widgets.</p>

<pre><code class="java Getting certain elements from selenium driver">protected static ArrayList&lt;WebElement&gt; getVisibleElements(String tagName,
            final String classString) {
        List&lt;WebElement&gt; elements = driver.findElements(By.tagName(tagName));
        return Lists.newArrayList(Collections2.filter(elements,
                new Predicate&lt;WebElement&gt;() {
                    @Override
                    public boolean apply(@Nullable WebElement input) {
                        boolean b = false;
                        try {
                            String classAttribute = input.getAttribute("class");
                            b = input.isDisplayed() &amp;&amp; classAttribute != null
                                    &amp;&amp; classAttribute.contains(classString);
                        } catch (StaleElementReferenceException e) {
                            // Ignoring stale element
                        }
                        return b;
                    }
                }));
    }
</code></pre>

<h2>4. Issues</h2>

<p>We are quite happy how things are working now, but there is room for improvement:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The compile time during development</strong>: trying to change something in the client code in a iterative manner using the standard <strong>DevMode</strong> is very frustrating as it takes just too much time. <strong>SuperDevMode</strong> improved a lot our situation but we still have the problem of having the server and client side in one maven project - changing the server-side code means a <code>mvn clean -DskipTests tomcat7:run-war</code> and this means basically an &ldquo;espresso&rdquo; break.</li>
<li><strong>The size of the client</strong>: our *.cache.js file is currently 6.1MB (we use the gwtquery and gwt-chosen libs which are quite large) We will definitely try to introduce some code splitting in the future release, to load only as much as we need and not everything from the beginning.</li>
<li><strong>Execution time of the selenium tests</strong>: our current selenium suite takes a bit over 3 hours to run on our CI server. And although we could, we don&rsquo;t have enough of the presenter unit tests to have a sufficient coverage letting us sleep well at night. Here probably a wrong choice have been made: concentrating to much on the selenium tests and trying to go for a very exhaustive test suite, instead of implementing a good amount of unit tests for the presenters and a simpler selenium suite for the main work flows in the application.</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There&rsquo;s nothing like this moment, when you have a big smile on your face, because you&rsquo;re just stunned how well things are working and how simple the set-up process was. <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> is just amazing. <strong>Period</strong>. If you haven&rsquo;t heard about it and you&rsquo;re thinking to start a blog or migrate one, then you should definitely check it out. To put it simple:
<blockquote><p>Octopress is a framework designed by Brandon Mathis for Jekyll, the blog aware static site generator powering Github Pages. To start blogging with Jekyll, you have to write your own HTML templates, CSS, Javascripts and set up your configuration. But with Octopress All of that is already taken care of. Simply clone or fork Octopress, install dependencies and the theme, and you&rsquo;re set.</p><footer><strong>Brandon Mathis <a href="http://octopress.org/blog/2011/07/23/octopress-20-surfaces/">http://octopress.org/blog/2011/07/23/octopress-20-surfaces/</a></strong></footer></blockquote>
It took me just few hours from having the idea: <em>Today is the day to start my own blog</em> to actually having it hosted on github. And the experience itself (checking out the octopress repo, configuring, building and deploying to github) was really simple. Thumbs up for the good documentation!</p>

<h2>My setup</h2>

<ol>
<li><strong>octopress</strong> is publishing directly to my github user page. Therefore the access is fairly simple and I can use my blog to link to other stuff, I have on github or somewhere else like e.g. slides to my talks.</li>
<li>I decided against using the default theme and went with a clean and responsive one called the <a href="https://github.com/lucaslew/whitespace">whitespace</a>. There are many, many others so everyone should be able to find something suiting own needs. A list with some of the themes available: <a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress/wiki/3rd-Party-Octopress-Themes">3rd-Party-Octopress-Themes</a></li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>During the set-up phase I had only one ubuntu-related (using the 13.04) hickup. When executing the <code>bundle install</code> I got an missing dependency error, so after googling for like a minute, I found a simple solution: just execute <code>sudo apt-get install ruby1.9.1-full</code> and everything will work as described in octopress docs.</li>
<li>As I&rsquo;m a <strong>zsh</strong> and <a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh">oh-my-zsh</a> user, I run also into the <code>rake new_post[title]</code> execution problem. A solution for it was also easily found: just add <code>alias rake=&ldquo;noglob rake&rdquo;</code> to your <code>~/.zshrc</code>.</li>
<li>To be able to see, if anybody actually reads this stuff, I activated the support for google analytics in the <code>_config.yml</code> file.</li>
<li>I also activated <a href="http://disqus.com">disqus</a> to support comments. Although I&rsquo;ve never heard about it, it makes a very nice impression and as everything till now, was very easy to set-up (create an account, get unique id and put it into the <code>_config.yml</code> file). I deactivated all the <strong>discovery</strong> stuff from disqus though, as I&rsquo;m not interested in monetizing anything here.</li>
</ol>


<p>If you read it till now, you may be asking yourself <blockquote><p>OK, yet another possibility to create a blog. So what. Why bother with all this stuff when one can just use blogger or wordpress.com.</p></blockquote> My answer:</p>

<h2>Killer features &amp; the work-flow</h2>

<ol>
<li>Everything is hosted on github within my repository and I have control over all the files etc.</li>
<li>To create a new blog post you just type <code>rake new_post[&lsquo;some title&rsquo;]</code> and open the created file to edit the content. Everything will be written in markdown (<strong>+1</strong>), so I&rsquo;m using <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">sublime</a> as my editor and the <strong>distraction free mode</strong> when writing&hellip;</li>
<li>When you work on a new post or a change then you can tweak and test everything on your local machine under <code>localhost:4000</code> with each change made automatically visible thanks to <code>rake watch</code> and <code>rake preview</code></li>
<li>Everything is manged by git, so you can work on posts in branches etc.</li>
<li>When you&rsquo;re done, you just hit <code>rake generate</code> and <code>rake deploy</code> and the new stuff will be pushed to github.</li>
</ol>
