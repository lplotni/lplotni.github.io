    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Together with few friends we started building <strong><a href="https://github.com/lplotni/pace">pace</a></strong> - a web application for
organizing and managing running events &amp; competitions. We are a colorful bunch of people with different background, therefore we wanted to choose an approachable tech stack, as some of us wants also to learn one or two things about <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>web applications</strong> or <strong>programming</strong> in general.</p>

<p>And then, somebody suggested to write one thing or two, about our technology
decisions and accompany it with some <em>HowTo</em> information. So here we are.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>This is the first post out of the <strong>pace</strong> series. We will take a look at how to quickly bootstrap a new express.js application and what is acctually happening during that process.</p>

<h2>First things first: node.js &amp; express.js</h2>

<p><blockquote><p>Node.js® is a platform  built on Chrome&rsquo;s JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.</p><footer><strong>Nodejs.org <a href="https://nodejs.org">https://nodejs.org</a></strong></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>Probably also due to the popularity of JavaScript <a href="https://nodejs.org/">node</a> quickly spread all around the web and is nowadays widely <a href="https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/projects,-applications,-and-companies-using-node">used</a> and has an impressive ecosystem of additional libraries/modules (just take a look at <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm package manager</a>).</p>

<p><a href="http://expressjs.com/">express.js</a> is one of many web frameworks based on node, but seems also to be one of the most popular ones. What is a web framework you ask:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>A web application framework is a software framework that is designed to support the development of dynamic websites, web applications, web services and web resources. The framework aims to alleviate the overhead associated with common activities performed in web development. For example, many frameworks provide libraries for database access, templating frameworks and session management, and they often promote code reuse</p><footer><strong>Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application_framework">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application_framework</a></strong></footer></blockquote></p>

<h3>How to bootstrap a web app &amp; what happens</h3>

<p>Assuming you have node already installed on your machine (if not look at <a href="https://nodejs.org/download/">here</a>)</p>

<pre><code class="bash">npm install express-generator -g
express myWebApp
cd myWebApp
npm install
npm start
</code></pre>

<p>What happened you ask? So first we globally installed <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-generator">express-generator</a> (it will be now available to you via <em>express</em> cmd). Then we made it bootstrap for us an app called <em>myWebApp</em>. This resulted in the following:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">/tmp|⇒ express myWebApp

   create : myWebApp
   create : myWebApp/package.json
   create : myWebApp/app.js
   create : myWebApp/public
   create : myWebApp/public/javascripts
   create : myWebApp/public/images
   create : myWebApp/routes
   create : myWebApp/routes/index.js
   create : myWebApp/routes/users.js
   create : myWebApp/public/stylesheets
   create : myWebApp/public/stylesheets/style.css
   create : myWebApp/views
   create : myWebApp/views/index.jade
   create : myWebApp/views/layout.jade
   create : myWebApp/views/error.jade
   create : myWebApp/bin
   create : myWebApp/bin/www

   install dependencies:
     $ cd myWebApp &amp;&amp; npm install

   run the app:
     $ DEBUG=myWebApp ./bin/www
</code></pre>

<p>The generator created for us a new directory which contains all the needed files the web application consists of:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>package.json</strong> -> definition of our node dependencies and some node configuration</li>
<li><strong>app.js</strong> -> the main entry point into the application</li>
<li><strong>public</strong> -> contains all public assets whic will be exposed to the public</li>
<li><strong>routes</strong> -> contains the definitions of our routes (as ourDomain/index or ourDomain/somethingDifferent)</li>
<li><strong>views</strong> -> contains our templates (more about this in future posts)</li>
<li><strong>bin/www</strong> -> executable application (if you run <code>npm start</code> this will be started)</li>
</ul>


<p>The execution of <code>npm install</code> in app&rsquo;s directory, installs all the dependencies defined in the <code>package.json</code> file. Those dependencies will be installed only locally in the <code>node_modules</code> directory. After this step we are ready to go and able to run <code>npm start</code> which should result in this:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">myWebApp|⇒ npm start

&gt; myWebApp@0.0.1 start /private/tmp/myWebApp
&gt; node ./bin/www

GET / 200 305ms - 170b
GET / 200 34ms - 170b
GET /stylesheets/style.css 200 4ms - 110b
GET / 304 25ms
GET /stylesheets/style.css 304 1ms
</code></pre>

<p>You can see, that I opened <a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a> in the browser and express served me the index page with the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html">200 code</a> (you can also see that I refreshed the page and got 304 NOT MODIFIED). Everything works also as expected <img alt="+1" src="/images/emoji/unicode/1f44d.png" class="emoji" /></p>

<p><strong>Why? How?</strong> Let&rsquo;s take a quick look at the following:</p>

<pre><code class="JavaScript app.js">var routes = require('./routes/index');

app.use('/', routes)
</code></pre>

<p>This is only a part of the <code>app.js</code> file but shows the wiring of our default root to the index.js file shown below. BTW: you can also see how to load dependencies/modules for our code via the <code>require</code> function (if you want to read more about that, <a href="http://openmymind.net/2012/2/3/Node-Require-and-Exports/">here is a nice write-up</a>)</p>

<pre><code class="JavaScript routes/index.js">var express = require('express');
var router = express.Router();

/* GET home page. */
router.get('/', function(req, res) {
  res.render('index', { title: 'Express' });
});

module.exports = router;
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>index.js</code> uses express' <code>router</code> and wires request for <strong>/</strong> to the function responding with a rendered <code>index.jade</code> template, to which it passes a variable called <code>title</code>. If you never used <a href="http://jade-lang.com/">jade</a>, don&rsquo;t worry, is a pretty simple HTML template engine. Look at the following:</p>

<pre><code class="jade index.jade">extends layout

block content
  h1= title
  p Welcome to #{title}
</code></pre>

<p>Jade enables template composition. In here we extend <code>layout.jade</code> which defines the general page structure. If other template defines a <strong>block</strong> called <code>content</code> it will be then injected at the corresponding place.</p>

<pre><code class="jade layout.jade">doctype html
html
  head
    title= title
    link(rel='stylesheet', href='http://lplotni.github.io/stylesheets/style.css')
  body
    block content
</code></pre>

<p>Jade is indentation aware, meaning that the above example results in the following:</p>

<pre><code class="HTML">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Express&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="http://lplotni.github.io/stylesheets/style.css"&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Express&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Welcome to Express&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now you have seen all the parts making the browser render the most basic page of all time <img alt="sunglasses" src="/images/emoji/unicode/1f60e.png" class="emoji" /></p>

<p>Next post out of the <strong>pace</strong> series, will actually explain how to start working on the functionality we need. Right now you can start to play around with the data which is passed by the <code>index.js</code> to the <code>index.jade</code> template and how the template uses it. Have fun!</p>

    <link href="http://lplotni.github.io/blog/2015/06/27/build-monitors/"/>
    <updated>2015-06-27T15:41:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://lplotni.github.io/blog/2015/06/27/build-monitors</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>During my last four projects or so, the teams I worked with were always using <a href="http://www.go.cd/">GO.CD</a> as the CD tool of their
choosing. Although the pipeline state visualisation GO.CD comes with is quite nice, it still doesn&rsquo;t cut it as a proper,
<em>obvious</em> build monitor enabling everybody in the team to quickly recognize what is the pipeline status.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/burstah_example.png" title="Burstah in action" ></p>

<p>Therefore first <a href="https://github.com/lplotni/cidar">cidar</a>, a simple sinatra based build monitor, has been born. I quickly discovered
that sinatra and especially the nokogiri dependency, doesn&rsquo;t make it easy to use e.g. a Raspberry Pi as the monitor hardware. So,
having the liberty, I decided to re-implement everything in JavaScript using node.js &amp; express. <a href="https://github.com/lplotni/burstah">Burstah</a>
, my second attempt at the ultimative build monitor, has been born  <img alt="bowtie" src="/images/emoji/bowtie.png" class="emoji" /></p>

<!--more-->


<p>All the necessary information how to use, install or contribute can be found in <strong>Burstah</strong>&rsquo;s readme.</p>

<p>Currently <strong>Burstah</strong> has following features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Polling for the cctray.xml to recognize the pipelines and their status</li>
<li>Grabbing the commit details directly out of the GO.CD and presenting them</li>
<li>Providing an animation when the build is running</li>
<li>Supporting emojis in the commit messages <img alt="thumbsup" src="/images/emoji/unicode/1f44d.png" class="emoji" /></li>
</ul>


<p>If you have any wishes or issues, just write stuff down on the <a href="https://github.com/lplotni/burstah/issues">github issues page</a>.</p>

    <updated>2013-06-15T18:01:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://lplotni.github.io/blog/2013/06/15/gwt-part-i</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Back in 2009 I became the job to design and start realizing a quite large web application for a health care research project. I took some time, sat down and thought about the technology stack, I would like to use to build it. As we wanted to have an RIA and I already had some experience with GWT, we quickly decided to use it. Since then four years have passed and we are about to release the 2.0 version of our system. During this time, the whole team learned a lot about GWT, its advantages and also some disadvantages, and I thought it would be useful to write some of them up. This part is about the <strong>status quo</strong>, in the second part I will try to write about a GWT setup I would go for, when starting the project today - so if you have any hints in this regard, please feel free to leave a comment, I would definitely appreciate it!</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>1. Client setup</h2>

<p>Around the same time, as I started to draw the first diagrams of the inner life of our web app, Ray Ryan gave a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDuhR18-EdM">talk at the IO conference</a> about the best practices for GWT app architecture, mentioning the <a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/uiArchs.html">model view presenter</a>, the usage of an event bus for components communication and the command pattern for dispatching the GWT-RPC calls to the server. Shortly after I discovered the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gwt-presenter/">gwt-presenter</a> and the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gwt-dispatch/">gwt-dispatch</a> libraries, offering an easy way to build an GWT app based on the principles from  Ray&rsquo;s talk. I also found a very detailed <a href="http://blog.hivedevelopment.co.uk/2009/08/google-web-toolkit-gwt-mvp-example.html">blog post</a> explaining how everything works together.  <img src="/images/gwt_mvp.png" title="MVP with EventBus and Dispatcher" > At this point we defined one <strong>Presenter</strong> for all the entities, we wanted to made accessible on the client, and each presenter defined his own <strong>Display</strong> interface which then was implemented by the <strong>View</strong> class. The instantiation of all presenters and views has been managed by <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-gin/">gin</a> - a dependency injection framework for the client side. The code looked more or less like this:

In the gwt-presenter class hierarchy there was no possibility to define the model class the presenter will be responsible for. For that reason we introduced a <code>PresentDTO\&lt;T></code> and <code>PresentDTOs\&lt;T></code> interfaces to ensure the existence of <code>T getDTO()</code> etc. methods. The view classes are quite straightforward, the only difference is that back in 2009 ui:binder was not really there, therefore the gwt-presenter had no direct support for it. But switching to the declarative layout definition was indeed very easy - each view defines its own *.ui.xml file and the <code>asWidget()</code> method just returns the result of the <code>uiBinder.createAndBindUi()</code> call. As you can see in the code below we introduced also a <code>WidgetsManager</code> class which is a convinient way to managed all the widgets the view is defining (offering a general <code>setEditable()</code> method and taking care of the validation visualization).</p>

<pre><code class="java View">public class HistoryView implements Display {
    interface HistoryViewUiBinder extends UiBinder&lt;LayoutPanel, HistoryView&gt; {}
    private static HistoryViewUiBinder uiBinder = GWT.create(HistoryViewUiBinder.class);

    @UiField
    LabeledSuggestBox renalDisease;
    @UiField
    DateBox renalDiseaseStart;
    @UiField
    TextArea renalDiseaseText;
    @UiField
    ValueListBox hypertension;

    private final WidgetsManager widgetsManager;
    private final LayoutPanel content;

    @Inject
    public HistoryView(WidgetsManager widgetsManager, final RegisterConstants c) {
        this.widgetsManager = widgetsManager;

<p>To ensure a loosely coupled client we try to communicate between the presenters only via the EventBus or PlaceRequests, so if a new part of the UI should be rendered, a new place event needs to be fired.</p>

<h2>2. Client - server communication</h2>

<p>The client - server communication is based fully on the GWT-RPC mechanism. As mentioned above we are using the gwt-dispatch library meaning that for every request, we have a command object, result object and a server side handler. It is a bit verbose, but in the end it is also a very simple pattern and every new dev introduced to our team grasps it very quickly. The implementation of the client-side caching is easily done, as you just need to compare the command object which should be executed and if one of them has been already seen, then you can serve the already received result saving you one round-trip.</p>

<p>To execute a command a corresponding object just needs to be passed to the dispatcher which is a singleton on the client and gets injected to every presenter that should be able to trigger the communication. In most of the cases the result of a command (or to use gwt-dispatch terminology: an action) contains a DTO object which is then shown by the presenter. On the server side we are using JPA &amp; Hibernate so obviously we need to take care of the server entity to DTO conversion. Although some libraries exists for this purpose (e.g <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gilead/">gilead</a>), in our specific setting we decided to implement it ourself which was actually a straightforward task when using the reflection API and sticking to a well defined class hierarchy of our own. <img src="/images/dto.png" title="MVP with EventBus and Dispatcher" > We also use the JSR303 annotations for validation of the entities and are able to push the constraint violations back to the client where they will be assigned to the specific widgets by our <code>WidgetsManager</code> - here we are just using a simple convention of associating the input widgets with same names as the property paths in the entities.</p>

<h2>3. Testing the client</h2>

<p>One of the main advantages of doing MVP is the separation of the business logic (sitting in the presenter) from the actual UI components (being a part of the view) resulting in the ability of writing normal, fast unit test (normal, meaning not using the GWTTestCase) and mocking the views. Nevertheless in our project we use <a href="http://docs.seleniumhq.org/">selenium</a> as the main way to assure the correct functionality of our client. As using the normal selenium recorder is not an option with GWT due to the element ids changing during each compile process, we tried to get our selenium tests (written in java as normal unit tests) as independent as it only can be from the layout definition itself (trying not to use exact XPath etc.). Our client is very data input heavy, so we have a lot of input components to test. When we test if the entities get created in a correct way, we just access all visible input components of a certain type, populate them with a random content (which we then store for later comparison), trigger the save action and reload the UI to verify if the same components holds still the same data. Thus, we don&rsquo;t have to update the tests if our data definition changes and we have introduced some new input components. The test will also work if the layout of the UI changes either on purpose, because we rearranged it, or when a new GWT version switch to a different HTML representation for some standard widgets.</p>

<pre><code class="java Getting certain elements from selenium driver">protected static ArrayList&lt;WebElement&gt; getVisibleElements(String tagName,
            final String classString) {
        List&lt;WebElement&gt; elements = driver.findElements(By.tagName(tagName));
        return Lists.newArrayList(Collections2.filter(elements,
                new Predicate&lt;WebElement&gt;() {
                    @Override
                    public boolean apply(@Nullable WebElement input) {
                        boolean b = false;
                        try {
                            String classAttribute = input.getAttribute("class");
                            b = input.isDisplayed() &amp;&amp; classAttribute != null
                                    &amp;&amp; classAttribute.contains(classString);
                        } catch (StaleElementReferenceException e) {
                            // Ignoring stale element
                        }
                        return b;
                    }
                }));
    }
</code></pre>

<h2>4. Issues</h2>

<p>We are quite happy how things are working now, but there is room for improvement:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The compile time during development</strong>: trying to change something in the client code in a iterative manner using the standard <strong>DevMode</strong> is very frustrating as it takes just too much time. <strong>SuperDevMode</strong> improved a lot our situation but we still have the problem of having the server and client side in one maven project - changing the server-side code means a <code>mvn clean -DskipTests tomcat7:run-war</code> and this means basically an &ldquo;espresso&rdquo; break.</li>
<li><strong>The size of the client</strong>: our *.cache.js file is currently 6.1MB (we use the gwtquery and gwt-chosen libs which are quite large) We will definitely try to introduce some code splitting in the future release, to load only as much as we need and not everything from the beginning.</li>
<li><strong>Execution time of the selenium tests</strong>: our current selenium suite takes a bit over 3 hours to run on our CI server. And although we could, we don&rsquo;t have enough of the presenter unit tests to have a sufficient coverage letting us sleep well at night. Here probably a wrong choice have been made: concentrating to much on the selenium tests and trying to go for a very exhaustive test suite, instead of implementing a good amount of unit tests for the presenters and a simpler selenium suite for the main work flows in the application.</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There&rsquo;s nothing like this moment, when you have a big smile on your face, because you&rsquo;re just stunned how well things are working and how simple the set-up process was. <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> is just amazing. <strong>Period</strong>. If you haven&rsquo;t heard about it and you&rsquo;re thinking to start a blog or migrate one, then you should definitely check it out. To put it simple:
<blockquote><p>Octopress is a framework designed by Brandon Mathis for Jekyll, the blog aware static site generator powering Github Pages. To start blogging with Jekyll, you have to write your own HTML templates, CSS, Javascripts and set up your configuration. But with Octopress All of that is already taken care of. Simply clone or fork Octopress, install dependencies and the theme, and you&rsquo;re set.</p><footer><strong>Brandon Mathis <a href="http://octopress.org/blog/2011/07/23/octopress-20-surfaces/">http://octopress.org/blog/2011/07/23/octopress-20-surfaces/</a></strong></footer></blockquote>
It took me just few hours from having the idea: <em>Today is the day to start my own blog</em> to actually having it hosted on github. And the experience itself (checking out the octopress repo, configuring, building and deploying to github) was really simple. Thumbs up for the good documentation!</p>

<h2>My setup</h2>

<ol>
<li><strong>octopress</strong> is publishing directly to my github user page. Therefore the access is fairly simple and I can use my blog to link to other stuff, I have on github or somewhere else like e.g. slides to my talks.</li>
<li>I decided against using the default theme and went with a clean and responsive one called the <a href="https://github.com/lucaslew/whitespace">whitespace</a>. There are many, many others so everyone should be able to find something suiting own needs. A list with some of the themes available: <a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress/wiki/3rd-Party-Octopress-Themes">3rd-Party-Octopress-Themes</a></li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>During the set-up phase I had only one ubuntu-related (using the 13.04) hickup. When executing the <code>bundle install</code> I got an missing dependency error, so after googling for like a minute, I found a simple solution: just execute <code>sudo apt-get install ruby1.9.1-full</code> and everything will work as described in octopress docs.</li>
<li>As I&rsquo;m a <strong>zsh</strong> and <a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh">oh-my-zsh</a> user, I run also into the <code>rake new_post[title]</code> execution problem. A solution for it was also easily found: just add <code>alias rake=&ldquo;noglob rake&rdquo;</code> to your <code>~/.zshrc</code>.</li>
<li>To be able to see, if anybody actually reads this stuff, I activated the support for google analytics in the <code>_config.yml</code> file.</li>
<li>I also activated <a href="http://disqus.com">disqus</a> to support comments. Although I&rsquo;ve never heard about it, it makes a very nice impression and as everything till now, was very easy to set-up (create an account, get unique id and put it into the <code>_config.yml</code> file). I deactivated all the <strong>discovery</strong> stuff from disqus though, as I&rsquo;m not interested in monetizing anything here.</li>
</ol>


<p>If you read it till now, you may be asking yourself <blockquote><p>OK, yet another possibility to create a blog. So what. Why bother with all this stuff when one can just use blogger or wordpress.com.</p></blockquote> My answer:</p>

<h2>Killer features &amp; the work-flow</h2>

<ol>
<li>Everything is hosted on github within my repository and I have control over all the files etc.</li>
<li>To create a new blog post you just type <code>rake new_post[&lsquo;some title&rsquo;]</code> and open the created file to edit the content. Everything will be written in markdown (<strong>+1</strong>), so I&rsquo;m using <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">sublime</a> as my editor and the <strong>distraction free mode</strong> when writing&hellip;</li>
<li>When you work on a new post or a change then you can tweak and test everything on your local machine under <code>localhost:4000</code> with each change made automatically visible thanks to <code>rake watch</code> and <code>rake preview</code></li>
<li>Everything is manged by git, so you can work on posts in branches etc.</li>
<li>When you&rsquo;re done, you just hit <code>rake generate</code> and <code>rake deploy</code> and the new stuff will be pushed to github.</li>
</ol>
